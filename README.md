## About the Project

Hi, I'm Matheus ðŸ‘‹<br>
This project was created with the goal of putting into practice concepts learned in **HTML** and **CSS**.
The aim of this project is to demonstrate how it's possible to build a simple, elegant, and functional portfolio using these two fundamental web development technologies.

<br>  

> This project was developed as part of my learning journey and serves as a basic example for anyone looking to start building portfolio pages.
